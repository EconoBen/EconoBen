Like many others, I never intended to work in the tech industry. After a long bout of involuntary, post-undergraduate unemployment (I couldn't even get a job at Starbucks...), and a stint as a restoration ecologist, I entered the field after securing a job as an economic researcher at a "corporate startup"——a term which, I found, implies that a company means to be as tech-focused as a startup, but with more cash in-hand and with less agility (even while espousing [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)).

To someone who had only developed an affinity for math and statistics later in their college career, being surrounded by cutting-edge data science and tech work was invigorating. Yet, as time passed, and I pored over piles of research papers in the search of answers, I began to realize that it was the people around me on the computers who were actually _doing_ something of value (that I had this perception is, in hindsight, a post in its own right). They were creating understanding in a world of noise, while I was writing white papers of dubious utility.

As much as I loved my research, in being exposed to the data scientists and engineers around me, and in witnessing how useful and fascinating their work could be, I determined to teach myself what I needed to know to become a data scientist. What I didn't expect in the the ensuing months and years was that, in picking up the skills necessary to become a data scientist, I would also exacerbate a pervasive mentality that almost every person I've met in the field suffers: the productivity feedback loop of anxiety.

Before I describe the productivity feedback loop of anxiety in detail, I should point out emergesseeks meaning and signifiance 

So while there may be many others who similarly did not intend to enter the field, it still feels a unique insight to have noticed after 4 years in data science how similarly self-destructive tech workers are in their approach to their work. 
Maybe you've met the kind of person I'm talking about. This type of person consistantly feels a looming internal pressure to continually produce (or self-educate, which are seen as equivalent). So pressing is the need to be productive that there is almost an exponential relationship between the stress they feel and not having been productive over time. Only once they've produced will they begin to relax. But fear not, for like cloackwork these same individuals will soon thereafter chide themselves for relaxing too much, and start the cycle over again. 






The productivity feedback loop of anxiety works something like this: A person

work on thing that is perceived as productive -> ease existential anxiety -> move on -> realize you haven't been productive 

As I'm sure I will mention time and again in my posts, my interests tend to revolve around economics and the environment. 

So as I look back at my brief four years as a data scientist, 
Growing up I was If I've learned anything in my four years of tech, it's that the field is brimming over with people trying to prove themselves. A common lament is the significant  pressure be working on more projects, to understand each algroithm, to earn more money. These

, Much of this, I have concluded, comes from the perverse behavioral incetives.  of success
