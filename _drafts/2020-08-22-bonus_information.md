The original intent of this research was simply to 

In the future, I hope to write more about 

But to reiterate, but I imagine few have seen the [correspondence](http://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html) I dug up when researching the matter. 

The following exchange occurs when Austin Chronicle columnist, Richard Steiner, was, like me, curious about the origin of the use of daemon, and so reached out to the term's rumored progenitor, Professor Fernando Corbato.

Evidently, Corbat0 and his colleagues coined the term daemon in reference to James Clerk [Maxwell's Demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon): a famous thought experiment in which a passive demon, working in the background, would separate fast and slow particles into different bins, breaking the Second Law of Thermodynamics. On this, Maxwell may have been as much a Greek scholar as he was a scientist, for indeed the concept of a demon originally connoted a passive if inhuman, force. 

According to Walter Burket, scholar of Greek mythology and cult, we have Plato and his pupil Xenocrates to thank for [our modern interpretation of demons as evil and menacing](https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk/page/178/mode/2up?q=daemon). Before Plato, demon, _daimon_, or the Latin _daemon_, often had a neutral, if unknowable meaning closer to that of the fates than of evil beings. As Burket [so elegantly put it](https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk/page/178/mode/2up?q=daemon):

>Daimon is occult power, a force that drives man forward where no agent can be named. ... Daimon is the veiled countenance of divine activity. There is no image of a _daimon_, and there is no cult. _Daimon_ is thus the necessary complement to the Homeric view of the gods as individuals with personal characteristics; it covers that embarrasing remainder which eludes characterization and naming.

Incidentally, [members of Pythagorean cult claimed](https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk/page/180/mode/2up?q=daemon) they could hear and see _daimones_, and could not quite understand why others found this so off-putting.

From there, [we do not know with certainty](https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk/page/178/mode/2up?q=daemon)any further etymology of daemon.
