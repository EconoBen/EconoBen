# The Blog
In the field of machine learning, reinforcement learning is a method used in which agents within simulations aim to maximize rewards or minimize costs, often with very loose parameters.

With this blog, I too will aim to maximize the rewards of my research by sharing it with others. Probably the most enjoyable aspect of the work I do is simply getting to share with others the new things I've discovered. 

# Myself

My name is Ben Labaschin. As a data scientist, I work on machine learning and engineering problems of all kinds. Often times it's more interesting to me to share my work to the wider community, and that's when I come here to write.
